We're living in Crazy times.  Sure, all times are crazy if you look hard enough, but 2020 is Crazy with a capital 'C'.
History books crazy.  Events we'll all be remniscing about in our respective retirement homes crazy.  The type of Crazy that future generations will learn about middle school, memorizing death toll statistics without appreciating the human aspects until the Shmaltzy Hollywood period piece becomes a blockbuster.  Ken Burns documentary Crazy.  

So, it's safe to say that 2020 is a good a time as any to reflect on where we all our.  Certainly we're being forced to reconcile our communal place in sobering ways, but nothing ever really changes if we don't take a hard look at ourselves.

My name is Ben and I'm a musician.  Well, by trade I'm a musician anyhow.  My day job is waiting and bartending.  I've been doing that for close to 20 years, but I've been a musician even longer.  I started playing the bass guitar at age 9 and I instantly took it seriously.  While the neighborhood kids were out playing football in the street or playing ding dong ditch, I was holed up in my bedroom, happily dissecting Rush songs and working through my music theory work book.  I love telling people that I'm self taught, but the truth of the matter is that I had an in house teacher.

My older brother Aaron also took music to heart.  He eventually studied music composition in college but at first he was a Gen X  teen with a couple guitars and a decent pedal board.  He taught me everything I know and even though music might've been a first love for him, he eventually landed a career in Web Development.

Over the years I've seen the impact that a career in tech has had on my brother.  Aaron's worked for Bloomberg and CNBC just to name a couple of companies and when I would come down to visit him in his NYC apartment on the LES he would occasionally give me a couple basic examples of HTML or CSS.  Much like our earlier home life, he was sharing knowledge with me and it caught my attention.  I guess some relationship dynamics never change.

I'm 39 now and I've outgrown the service industry.  My experience in restaurants could fill up an entirely different blog, but the purpose of this isn't to go through the details of being a waiter, although it's an interesting topic on it's own.  However, a career change into something greater.  Something that contributes to the modern era and our every day experience.  To play a part in Web is to dig deeper into something that we engage with in an increasingly personal way.  It's no secret that time moves faster the further we age.  It's also no secret that 2020 is throwing curveballs even faster than that.  We can either play ball, or wait until the perfect game.  But if we don't make the choice now, the season is likely to pass us by without a thought.  You either engage, or you don't.  If you don't, you become another statistic in a text book no one wants to read.
